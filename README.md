# Simple Transformer AI Example

In this example, we'll demonstrate a basic implementation of a Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. This example shows how to perform text classification with a pre-trained model.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- PyTorch
- Transformers

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Create a Python script or use the provided `transformer_example.py`.

4. Modify the script to use the desired pre-trained Transformer model. You can change the `model_name` variable to any model you want to try (e.g., "gpt2", "roberta-base", "distilbert-base-uncased", etc.).

5. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

The script will:

- Load the selected pre-trained Transformer model.
- Tokenize the input text.
- Perform text classification.
- Print the results.

Make sure you have an internet connection when you run the script for the first time, as it will download the pre-trained model weights from the Hugging Face model hub.

## Example

You can run the provided `transformer_example.py` script to see a simple text classification example using a Transformer model.

```bash
python transformer_example.py
```

This will load a pre-trained model, tokenize the input text, and make a text classification prediction.
